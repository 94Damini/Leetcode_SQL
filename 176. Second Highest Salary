**# Table: Employee**

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report null.

The query result format is in the following example.

 **Input: **

Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+

### Write your MySQL query statement below

**First Method**



```
with cte as 
(select * , Dense_Rank() over ( order by id desc) as rn 
from employee
) 
select salary as SecondHighestSalary
from cte
where rn = 2
```



**Alternate method**

```
select 
         max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
from 
        employee 
where 
         salary< 
(select max(salary) from employee) 
```


**Output: **

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
